<h1>Educator Perspectives on Multitiered Systems of Support: A Text Mining Analysis</h1>
<p>Multitiered systems of supports (MTSS) is a framework for organizing interconnected levels or tiers of evidence-based pedagogy and academic and behavioral interventions for students based on their skills and level of need [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Harlacher2014">Harlacher, Sakelaris, and Kattelman (<a href="#ref-Harlacher2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> ].&nbsp; The most common framework for MTSS is a three-tiered approach in which Tier 1 comprises universal evidence-based instruction and social-emotional and behavioral supports, Tier 2 includes interventions targeted to groups of struggling students, and Tier 3 includes individualized interventions for students who fail to respond to Tier 1 and 2 interventions. MTSS combines earlier systems of support in schools including Response to Intervention (RtI) which focuses on academic interventions, and Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS), which focuses on behavioral and social-emotional interventions [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Jimmerson2016">Jimerson, Burns, and VanDerHeyden (<a href="#ref-Jimmerson2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> ]. Most central to the ethos of MTSS is the belief that all students are able to meet grade-level expectations given the right support [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Harlacher2014">Harlacher, Sakelaris, and Kattelman (<a href="#ref-Harlacher2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> ]. While MTSS is not inherently focused on developmental processes, the approach is nevertheless influenced by developmental science. Notably, developmental psychology provides critical insights into how children learn and grow, which directly informs the implementation of MTSS in schools. MTSS approaches must be differentiated by student’s age, grade, and cultural background, among other key characteristics. By assessing educators’ perspectives on MTSS, including their sentiments and the topics they discuss, we can better understand the alignment between the developmental needs of students and the actual implementation of MTSS within schools. This research aims to bridge the gap between developmental theory and educational practices by exploring how educators perceive and implement MTSS strategies to support student development.</p>
<section id="the-promise-of-mtss" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-promise-of-mtss">The Promise of MTSS</h2>
<p>When implemented with fidelity, the promise of MTSS is that all students receive support before experiencing failure academically, socially, emotionally, and behaviorally. Inherent within this approach is a need to differentiate service structures and supports across levels of development, with the form, focus and complexity of intervention changing as students gain cognitive, social, and emotional maturity. For example, reading intervention research has consistently found that receiving strong phonics-based core instruction, as well as teacher-delivered intervention targeted at developing basic reading skills such as print knowledge, rhyming, and phonological awareness, is essential for students in preschool to early primary school (grade 3). As students grow older and gain cognitive and emotional sophistication, there continues to be need for basic phonics-based reading instruction; however, vocabulary development, reading comprehension strategies, and interventions targeting reading self-efficacy become increasingly important [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Paul2016">Paul and Clarke (<a href="#ref-Paul2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> ] . Thus, MTSS structures and interventions must consider the developmental needs of students.</p>
<p>In addition to being differentiated by the level of development of students, MTSS is also well equipped to interrupt developmental cascades. Developmental cascades refer to the process by which early experiences, skills, or difficulties shapes future outcomes within the same domain or spreads to other related domains [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Masten2010">Masten and Cicchetti (<a href="#ref-Masten2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> ]. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="Valdez2011">Valdez, Lambert, and Ialongo (<a href="#ref-Valdez2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> found that students with early academic and peer-related challenges and those with academic, behavioral, and peer-related challenges in elementary school were more likely to be diagnosed with a mood or conduct disorder, experience academic failure, and utilize school-based or other mental health services in adolescence. By taking a whole-child approach in which all aspects of a child’s educational, social-emotional, and behavioral needs addressed, MTSS may be well positioned to prevent or mitigate the later emergence of more significant academic and behavioral challenges among youth [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Farmer2021">Farmer et al. (<a href="#ref-Farmer2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> ].</p>
</section>
<section id="challenges-in-mtss-implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-in-mtss-implementation">Challenges in MTSS Implementation</h2>
<p>While MTSS, with its differentiated and structured approach to meeting student needs, may be beneficial for students and school communities, the very act of differentiation may limit is feasibility in implementation. <span class="citation" data-cites="Shepley2019">Shepley and Grisham-Brown (<a href="#ref-Shepley2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> note that one of the greatest difficulties in implementing MTSS in an early childhood education setting is that academic and behavioral skills develop rapidly in the early developmental period. Thus, standards and skills that may apply to students must be updated continuously to match their newly emerging capabilities. Educators must also adapt MTSS to serve other student characteristics, such as multilingual learners. <span class="citation" data-cites="Grande-Gonzalez2024">Grande Gonzalez et al. (<a href="#ref-Grande-Gonzalez2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> in their survey of school psychologists on MTSS practices for emergent bilingual students, found that schools generally lack culturally and linguistically relevant core curricula, interventions, and evidence-based instructional approaches, such as simultaneous heritage language and English proficiency development.</p>
<p>Challenges with MTSS may also be unique to the setting in which interventions are implemented (e.g.&nbsp;early education, primary, secondary, etc.), as well as the role of individual implementing supports (e.g.&nbsp;school psychologists, teachers, administrators etc.). In terms of setting specific issues, secondary schools may especially struggle to implement MTSS given logistical challenges such as creating time during the school day for intervention, staffing, and lack of available space for interventions. Similarly, instructional challenges are present as well, including the fact that most secondary schools operate within a highly siloed departmentalized structures (e.g.&nbsp;math, science, English, etc.) which limits school-wide collaboration and synergy. Further, intervention programs are often not designed for secondary students, and teachers are often not trained to provide basic skill instruction that many secondary students may still need [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Durrance2023"><span>“Implementing MTSS in Secondary Schools: Challenges and Strategies | National Center on Safe Supportive Learning Environments (NCSSLE)”</span> (<a href="#ref-Durrance2023" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span> ] . Challenges associated with MTSS implementation may also be unique to the role of the individual implementing interventions. Teachers in particular are often tasked with the direct implementation of universal curricula, data collection and progress monitoring of students, and often must provide small group interventions. However, <span class="citation" data-cites="Castro-Villarreal2014">Castro-Villarreal, Rodriguez, and Moore (<a href="#ref-Castro-Villarreal2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> in their survey of teachers perceptions on RtI implementation found that teachers frequently reported having a lack of training in evidence-based academic interventions, data collection and interpretation, and time during the school day to implement Tier 2 interventions especially. Similarly, related research has found that teachers often lack critical behavioral management and intervention skills, which may limit their ability to effectively respond to the social-emotional and behavioral needs of students [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Flower2017">Flower, McKenna, and Haring (<a href="#ref-Flower2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> ].</p>

<section id="present-study" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="present-study">Present Study</h2>
<p>Review of the extant literature indicates that MTSS holds promise in meeting the needs of students in a developmentally appropriate manner, mitigate school failure, and reduce potential long-term negative academic, behavioral, and social-emotional outcomes. However, several structural and professional barriers may exist that limits teachers especially in their ability to implement MTSS and its associated interventions with fidelity. Thus, the present study examines the perceptions of educators on MTSS, including their sentiments regarding MTSS implementation, topics and interventions discussed, and the sources of challenges they raise in MTSS implementation. Specifically, discussions by educators on Reddit are examined through the r/Teachers subreddit, which is a community with 1.2 million members dedicated to discussing any topic related to teaching [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Redditn.d">(<a href="#ref-Redditn.d" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Redditn.d?</strong></a>)</span>. ].This community is examined in order to understand how teachers naturally discuss and view MTSS. The following questions are explored in this case study.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What are general sentiments educators on Reddit express regarding MTSS?</li>
<li>What topics are most frequently discussed by educators on Reddit regarding MTSS?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-1-what-are-general-sentiments-educators-on-reddit-express-regarding-mtss" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="question-1-what-are-general-sentiments-educators-on-reddit-express-regarding-mtss">Question 1: What are general sentiments educators on Reddit express regarding MTSS?</h2>
<p>The first question requires the use of sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a method for quantifying how individuals feel regarding a topic. Sentiment analysis examines subjective elements, such as words, sentences, and paragraphs for their emotional quality [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Taboada2016">Taboada (<a href="#ref-Taboada2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> ]. Sentiment analysis is conducted by comparing subjective elements against dictionaries or lexicons that have been pre-rated by researchers or through crowd-sourcing for their emotional quality by either assigning a qualitative label (e.g.&nbsp;positive, negative) or through assigning a quantitative value (e.g.&nbsp;1 – 5) [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Silge2017">Robinson and David (<a href="#ref-Silge2017" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span> ]. For example, a word such as “hate” might be assigned a 1, indicating a negative sentiment and “love” might assigned a 5 to indicate a positive sentiment. Several lexicons exist; however, given the nature of the data collected in the present study, Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER; <span class="citation" data-cites="Hutto2014">Hutto and Gilbert (<a href="#ref-Hutto2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> ) was utilized as it is trained to analyze the sentiments of short social media posts.</p>
<p>The first step in conducting an analysis using R is to load necessary packages. Packages are user created collections of code that are designed to execute functions and expand the scope of analyses that are able to be conducted using R. For the present study, the following packages are used:</p>

<p>Next, we’ll use the RedditExtractoR <span class="citation" data-cites="Rivera2023">Rivera (<a href="#ref-Rivera2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> package to extract posts that relate to MTSS. First, keywords are specified so that all posts that contain the words MTSS, RtI, and PBIS as well as their derivatives are collected. The <code>find_thread_urls()</code> function is used to retrieve Reddit data from the r/Teachers subreddit sorted by the top ranked posts over the month of October. The month of October is selected as selecting longer timeframes resulted in very large datasets that makes later analyses highly computationally intensive. Since this method is likely to generate duplicates, an additional function is specified to remove duplicate entries.</p>

My colleague was murdered last night                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Her husband murdered her in front of their children and then killed himself.  One of her daughters still attends this school. This teacher was my daughter\031s favorite and helped her through some rough times. She helped me through rough times.  She was one of those dream colleagues with a positive attitude, great sense of humor and a willingness to go the extra mile.\n\nHow do I walk back into the classroom and support everyone else when all I want to do is break down myself?  We\031ve got counselors on site but they aren\031t in my room.
Well I Got Spit On                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In my face. And it wasn\031t by accident and it was accompanied by being called a bitch and a ho. Because he was vaping and I wasn\031t putting up with his nonsense. Went from 0 to 60 real quick and thankfully the SRO and behavior techs were right there. Wasn\031t even my student- I had no idea who this kid was I was just supposed to bring him to the office. \n\nI didn\031t want to press charges but the school is moving forward. My admin was super supportive and sent me home for the day. I don\031t know why it upset me so much but I couldn\031t stop crying once one of my coworkers asked me what happened. I don\031t know why but I feel guilty that he is going to get charged with assault and arrested. My coworker made a really good point that it\031s not just about me, it\031s about the treatment of teachers in general and a line has to be drawn. \n\nJust need a sanity check from y\031all. \n\nUPDATE: thank you all genuinely. I teach in the inner city and have a really great relationship with my students who know who this kid is now have my back and are ready to fight =\002 \n\nMy school is pressing charges and pursuing expulsion. My admin and team have been incredibly supportive. Currently waiting to hear back from my Dr about whether to come in or get bloodwork or anything. Went to my sister\031s to shower and get my shit together before getting my kid. This job is fucking hard but I\031m going back tomorrow. \n\nUpdate 2: This blew up waaaaay more than I was expecting. So since this all went down, several of my coworkers have reached out to me, the girls on the school softball team I coach are preparing to be my personal body guards, and I wrote up a statement for the expulsion hearing as requested by my admin. SRO said that if the student shows up in the morning he will be getting arrested. The guilt mostly comes from not knowing the student and feeling like it was weird how fast he went off on me. Turns out he\031s just that way and I found out from coworkers that this is not necessarily an isolated event, just the first time it\031s escalated this much. \n\nI want to be clear- I believe in the systemic racism of the education system. I believe in the school to prison pipeline. I believe that relationships with students are important. I also believe that a relationship between schools and the police can be beneficial and that we need to do more to protect our public servants. Assaulting an educator or a nurse should be treated like assaulting an officer. I will go out of my way to try to understand things from a student\031s perspective but as many of you said, better he be charged in the school building, than caught out on the street with the wrong person. I truly appreciate all the support I have received and am home spending some well deserved time with my kiddo. 
Sub Teacher Here, Why Is Everything on Chromebooks Now?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      USA context. Writing this while on a prep period. \n\nI get it. Having students be on the Chromebooks all day makes for easy sub plans. You never know who you\031re gonna get so plan for the lowest common denominator.\n\nHowever, after taking middle &amp;amp; high school jobs and asking other teachers about their Chromebook use, all I have heard is that everyone and everything is pushing to \034go digital\035 as much as possible.\n\nPros: It saves trees, paper, etc. It makes it easier to grade for the teachers. Students can\031t lose their papers (they rarely have any paper, actually). There are apps that sometimes do things you couldn\031t possibly do using pen/paper. Students have access to the entire internet. Students can see things up close on a personal screen (rather than having to squint at main classroom screen/board).\n\nCons: Constant potential for distraction (games on a different tab). Difficulty \034having eyes\035 on student work and progress. Makes learning highly \034tunneled\035 and isolated from classmates and teacher. Students can look up everything on Google and copy/paste everything. Can use online calculators and copy/paste answers. Eye strain. And most importantly: no research supports positive improvements in academic achievement (actually shows the opposite).\n\nDid I miss anything?\n\nSo, Teachers of Reddit, I know everyone believes that they are using these devices \034in a good way\035, but do you honestly believe your colleagues are? Is this an issue of too much autonomy and lack of accountability to make sure these devices are actually helping and not just a babysitter that makes it easier to manage your paperwork?\n\nI\031m a former full time teacher so I\031m calling out myself in all this as well. When I get back in the classroom I think I\031m going to be a pariah and just say NO to all tech most of the time. Would I be shunned by my colleagues? Will the students throw me out?\n\nUgh. Just feeling like this profession has really changed a lot in the 10 years I\031ve been out of it. Subbing has been eye opening. I feel like y\031all are frogs in the kettle and haven\031t seen how drastic the tech madness has become. Or maybe you do see the issue \024 how do you address it in your teaching?
I got written up                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Edited. Thank you for all your support and ideas. Here\031s an update. I called in sick today to get all my ducks in a row. I first called HR and submitted my written rebuttal. I was on fire with my rebuttal. I CC\031d my response to my principal. I told HR that I would NOT be signing my write up. Ever. I then reached out to Uniform Compliant stating that I felt this write up was in retaliation. Period. I then reached out to Title IX and filed a complaint for allowing racial slurs. I called my union and spoke with a union rep. I also filed a complaint with OCR. I am in the process of filing with Dept  of Education.  Who knows what the outcome will be. I will NEVER allow my black students to feel less than. Ever.   HR contacted me with a weak response and they wanted to set up a meeting. I had the balls to ask them if this meeting was going to be me defending myself or to address the bigger issue. They told me they would like to \034review\035 the principals write up with me. So I told  them I won\031t be attending a meeting. Period. I did send an email documenting every where I filed a complaint. I figure I\031m in year 26 and if I\031m going out I\031m going out with flames. \nProbably will fired but at least I stood up for those students. \n\nIt finally happened after years of teaching I got written up. I teach 3rd grade. This particular student is a handful and likes to blurt out racist names. She kept calling three other students \034Black African Monkeys\035 I sent her to my co teachers class to write a \034fix it behavior note\035. Mom got wind of this and went to the principal. The principal called me in and backed the mom. The mom is known in our school for ranting and raving about everything. I was written up for \034falsely accusing a student of racial slurs\035. He has no backbone with parents. I\031m so done with this job. \n\n
What to do with student who refuses to work, respond, or even acknowledge you.                                                                                                                                                                                               Hey all,\nI\031m a 9th year public high-school teacher. Our school is city adjacent, mostly low income.\n\nI have a junior in my 3rd period who is like having a giant rock in my class. He will refuse to work, refuse to participate, refuse to even respond to me, or any of the other teachers. We called home and spoke to mom numerous times who says she\031ll speak to him about it. We have talked to the councilors and the social workers who said that they are aware of him and that he does not have adhd, depression, 504s, anything. The councilors and social workers have also tried working with him, evaluated him, he\031s not SPED. They say it\031s his mostly just his avoidance behavior. His dean (the school disciplinarians) said not to send him to the SW, councilor, or deans office because he simply wants to not be in class, and it is giving him what he wants. \n\nSo I have a student who is wholly defiant, sleeps through my class, and sometimes snores so loudly that it disrupts everything. The other student mostly ignore him, with some trying to engage with him every so often in a positive way, without any response. I have tried to have conversations with him on numerous levels, tried numerous different tactics to try to get him to engage, talk, anything. He will not respond, or sometimes just continuously says \034&amp;uh-huh&amp;uh-huh&amp;uh-huh&amp;\035\n\nHe can participate. After the first phone call home he got with it and was able to work well, ask questions, complete all of his work. He was a really great student and person underneath it this barrier. However, two days later, back to being an unmovable unresponsive rock. Will pretend you do not exist.\n\nHis dean has recommended that I move him to a stand up deck so that he cannot put his head down. I have tried but he will refuse to move and ignore you. The dean suggested I move the desk away, so that he has nothing to put his head down on. He will move the desk back and then put his head down.\n\nI am a bit flabbergasted and don\031t know what to do. Before anyone asks, our deans, councilors, and social workers are very good. They work super hard, are professional, advocate for students, and don\031t simply \034pass the buck\035, and the same goes for the rest of our faculty. Also before the obvious \034what about his home life\035 the support team has investigated numerous times and based on their investigation, there is nothing that explains the behavior.\n\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? What did you try to do? Was there any success?\n\n*UPDATE*\nSpoke to dean who met with mom. New policy is that if he tries to sleep in class, he will given a warning, then if he is defiant he will be sent home. Mom will then have to come into the school for him to be readmitted the next day. \n\nPersonally \nI don\031t understand how he can just sit there, blankly for hours and hours each day. It must be just so SO boring&amp;
Absolutely lost it at a student today.                                         This student... they are just... there's no words. I teach 3rd grade. This student is constantly disrupting class and does whatever they want to do. They have hardly turned in any work to me. They simply do not do the work. Won't even try. They constantly rip papers up and throw trash all around my floor. Constant behaviors. Slamming his desk against other students desks, slamming his Chromebook, throwing headphones, stealing stuff. He kicked me a few weeks ago. He leaves the classroom (elopes). \n\nI've tried ignoring the unwanted behaviors. It makes it worse. He escalates more when you ignore him by getting up, walking around the classroom, hitting other desks, throwing himself on the floor, kicking and punching the walls, tearing posters off the wall, hitting himself, etc. \n\nI've tried incentives. Different incentives will work for one day. I've tried chips, candy, extra PE. It will literally work for one day. And then he will tell you that he doesn't care if he doesn't get his incentive, and will continue his behavior. \n\nI've tried negative reinforcement. You act a certain way, you lose a privilege. It somewhat works, but not always. \n\nI've written over 20 referrals. I've collaborated with behavioral coaches and ECE. We are putting interventions in place. \n\nWe've started a break system. \n\nI let him use the cool down tent. He abuses it. \n\nI've taken away his desk at 2 different points. \n\nI've moved his seat 6 different times. \n\nParent teacher conference (mom has no questions or concerns of course). \n\nI've tried more one-on-one time. But I can only offer so much time without taking away from my other students. I'm at a Title 1 school and am a first year teacher. I have a lot of ML students and over half of my class performed below the 20th percentile on state testing. So there's a lot of heavy backpacking already taking place when planning. \n\nI give positive praise when I can. \n\nBut even when this kid is having a GREAT day, compared to his bad days, it's still not a good day... he still has no work for me to grade. There's no academic progress. A good day is literally him staying in his seat and raising his hand 60% of the time when he needs something instead of taking a tour of the classroom. \n\nWell today I snapped. He just wouldn't stop disrupting class and wouldn't follow expectations. I straight up screamed at him and in his face to sit down and that I'm writing him another referral. Didn't work of course. Ended up having him removed for the rest of the day. \n\nThe behavior coach is pushing for suspension. So hopefully he gets suspended and I get what will feel like a vacation. \n\nETA: I did feel guilty for losing it in front of my other students. I apologized to them after sitting and breathing for a couple of minutes. I explained that I'm extremely frustrated and that I should not have screamed. I just need a break. \n\nETA: I did NOT expect this to blow up like it did. Thank you all so much for the support. I will make a separate post with an update\n\nUpdate here \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/s/roKNIdusdQ\n
"PBIS distinguished" is just a "don't work here" marker at this point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Every school I've seen that has this marker is one that is cooking their books massively and just doesn't discipline kids.\n\nMy school, which is still better than my last but still, just got this. How you ask?\n\nIf kids get up and scream and curse each other out for 30 minutes but don't actually fight they come back to class the next day. Then they have the audacity to say it's because they don't need to miss instructional time.\n\nSo what does the girl who can barely read do as soon as I say it's time to do independent reading? She just says something to the girl with a hair trigger and they scream and cuss each other out for the whole work period. Then they get to skip their next class and go to ISS where they can sleep. \n\nNow my entire class has lost their instructional time. 
A quick and dirty guide to fixing American Public Education                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The American public education system is not just in need of tweaks; it's in need of a complete overhaul. The truth is, without radical  systemic changes, no amount of effort will truly fix what\031s broken. Here\031s a realistic  outline for fixing education: Feel free to add  to the list in the comment section\n\n* **Increase Teacher Pay:** Want quality education? Start by paying educators a living wage. Teachers shouldn\031t have to work second jobs just to survive.\n* **More Planning Time, Less Paperwork:** Teachers need time to actually plan lessons and assess student work\024imagine that! Cut the endless stream of redundant paperwork so they can focus on what matters: teaching.\n* **Real Discipline Support:** Schools need solid systems in place to manage disruptive behavior. Teachers shouldn\031t be left to fend for themselves in chaotic classrooms.\n* **Enforce an aggressive No-Cell-Phone Policy:** Students are more glued to their phones than their textbooks. A strict no-cell-phone rule in class would help everyone focus. It will make kids less isolated and awkward.\n* **Overhaul School Funding:** Stop funding schools based on enrollment. This system forces schools to retain disruptive students simply because they need the funding. Schools should be able to prioritize quality education over a headcount.\n* **Allow for Quality Control:** Schools should have the ability to remove students who routinely disrupt learning. Keeping chronically disruptive students for the sake of funding compromises everyone\031s education and teacher's sanity and safety.\n* **Reduce the School Week:** A 3-4 day school week would boost productivity for both students and teachers. By Friday, everyone is burnt out, and adding more days won\031t magically result in more learning. Teachers could use that extra day for planning and grading, which would actually improve instruction quality. But let\031s be honest: it won\031t happen because capitalism\031s gears keep grinding.
I have an autistic student in my class that I cannot handle anymore                                                                                                   I wanna start by saying I'm not mad at the kid for this, I genuinely feel that she and I were both abandoned by admin. I teach 8th grade at an all girls school, and this year I have an autistic student who is really struggling.\n\nShe becomes angry and gets aggressive very easily. I can no longer play review games in my class because it always ends with her screaming and clearing her table. At the beginning of the year, I was able to reach out to admin/guidance for support, but now anytime I reach out it just goes ignored. According to our Exed teacher, this student was reevaluated last year and no longer gets 1-on-1 support (which is what's needed in this case). \n\nThis student has touched me inappropriately, hisses at me and other students, swats at me and other students, has threatened to burn my house down, and so much more. She consistently acts up and it derails my class to the point I have to stop what I'm doing to handle her. She reads on a first grade level and was placed in my advanced science class- I tried to have her moved into a class with lower performing students and was told no. She is currently failing all of her classes and needs more support than any of her teachers can provide. She literally keyboard smashes to answer questions on assignments. \n\n\\\\When we bring these problems up, we're just told that per her IEP we are to give her extra credit to bring her grade up (which doesn't work because she isn't comprehending the material). I tried to move her away from my desk after the incident of her touching me inappropriately (I also reported this in case she was being abused by someone, followed up, and never heard back), but per her IEP she is supposed to be seated near the teacher so that was shot down quickly. This has never happened in my class, but she has urinated on herself in other teacher's classes. She cannot properly care for herself when she is on her period and often bleeds through her clothes and has to be sent to the office to change. She also picks at her skin and smears blood on the tables and classroom materials- which the teachers are forced to clean. I've has to throw books away because she has smeared blood on the pages. On a field trip, she tried to punch another student in the back of the head. \n\nI have reached out to her guardian, but at this point I'm 99% sure her guardian has blocked the school number because I can never get through to her. Our VP calls her guardian from her personal cell phone to contact her. Today was our first day back from fall break and she flipped out on me because I wouldn't let her eat her breakfast in class (a half dozen donuts)- no eating in my class is a consistent rule since we have a lab space.\n\nI have a tracker for her behavior- it includes all the times I've reached out for help and was either ignored or told I should be able to handle it on my own. I'm really at my breaking point, I feel awful quitting over one student but I cannot handle her anymore unless I get proper supports.

They\031re there to \034support\035 teachers.  Typically they are in fact counter to the support teachers need.\n\nExample:\n\nI teach at a below average performing school (the effects of language barriers, poverty, etc.  We\031re working on it) in an average district in an above average ranked state.  \n\nMy school has a behavior specialist that actually doesn\031t work with children at all.  She just tells teachers what to do.\n\nComments she has made/things she has done:\n\n\034It doesn\031t matter if they\031re learning.  We just want to keep them in school.\035\n\nShe will stand and watch an eloper with special needs that jumped out of his mom\031s car in the drop off lane headed off school property to the busy street , then after the fact say to the teacher like \034Don\031t follow and engage with him.  It reinforces the behavior\035.\n\n\034X (fifth grader, no 504, no iep, no behavior plan) shouldn\031t have to do that assignment (district required curriculum).  She likes to have choices and said she doesn\031t want to do it\035\n\nTo me: \034Your expectations are too high.  Fourth graders can\031t be expected to do independent work for 15 minutes\035.  You should let them work together so they have less anxiety (it was a test)\n\nI am convinced she\031s either incompetent, or is nefariously enabling the kids with behavior struggles to Lee struggling so her job seems necessary.\n\nEnd of rant.  I\031m just irritated.

I teach high school at a technical school and my class is so under funded. We are a technology class working with systems from the early 2000s. Which makes it slightly difficult to teach upcoming technologies. The lack of support from admin has even trickled down to my students. I never say anything to them about the lack of funds, but they have noticed and have mentioned things in the past.  Every single year,  I would asked to apply for a grant to upgrade my classroom. I was always told no. I assumed it was to put more money into our showcase labs (obviously it's never said, but those are the labs that get grants approved).\nThis year, I got a new supervisor and when I asked she said to go ahead and apply. Today I got the notification that I have been accepted for the grant!!!! I'm so excited. It's not life changing classroom money, but it's a start! The students are so excited to get upgraded tech! I'm so happy, I literally cried in class because I never thought I'd get accepted. \nI worked countless hours on this grant and it all paid off! I'm really hoping the admin can see what I'm trying to do with my class so we can get more grants. One day we actually be up to date and not living in the 2000s! 
School  got dropped from "outstanding" to "requires improvement" during OFSTED report from last year. instead of looking at management and SLT, or the amount of unpaid hours we do (i do 2-4 hours unpaid a week minimum) we must do everything but; home sick with work related injury.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       no training, no looking at the inorganic expanding of the school leading to chronic high levels of short staffedness, unpaid hours (in my class alone, 4 out of 8 members of staff stay a minimum of one hour late a week 3 days a week every week, myself- i do that too and sometimes still take my paperwork home with me).\n\ni'm off sick with a concussion that lead to me going to hospital after a CYP punched me in the head 3 times and i was physically sick and stuttering non stop, nearly dropping to the floor almost passing out- all i could think about was that i hoped he was okay; and hoping im gonna get paid for today- the one day im taking off because im worried of staffing levels- and worrying about how im gonna get all the paperwork i need to catch up on and do from this incident unpaid.\n\nbut ya know- instead of doing anything useful, we have a new policy for signing into and out of the building, and new systems we need to figure out that are broken or not working properly implemented with minimal training and lack luster support, hiring unqualified people, and everything is a pissing contest with management and half the managers are just assholes for no reason half the time doing shit that makes 0 sense.\n\nmakes me lose my mind.\n\nalso i am aware im not a qualified teacher yet, just a teaching assistant, but in the SEND school i work at we provide lessons and are expected to pick up the slack (plan lessons, find resources and run a lesson) multiple times a term, for the same pay as a TA- whilst teachers are out instead of the school paying for substitutes. if we're lucky a member of management will run our class for half a day while we catch up.\n\nso that's fun. lol 
[Vietnam] [Science/Grade 2] - Having a small success with a student!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I have a few classes I only see once a week. One of them is a Grade 2 class where I teach science. Now in this school system, there isn't really any provision for SpEd, so the children with additional needs often get dumped in normal classes and often not given a lot of support or are even ignored. This class has a girl in it who has an obvious learning difficulty of some sort, she barely communicates verbally in her own language. \n\n  When I first started teaching this class, I could NOT get through to this student. She seemed to be completely disengaged and didn't even respond to translated instructions/help. Neither was she looking at me or my assistant or the board. Getting her to actually try and complete a worksheet in any way, shape or form was impossible. I genuinely felt bad for her in a way because it must be so hard for her. \n\n Over the last few weeks I tried a few different things to engage with her 1-to-1, which can be easier said than done in a classroom of 34 students. Slowly, I noticed that she was engaging more, actually looking at me when I was talking (and I saw smiles a few times!) and started at the least *trying* to do the worksheets, even if she did often end up scribbling on them or not finishing. Then this week I noticed she was far more engaged with me- when I went into the class she was finishing some of her Vietnamese language work and was showing me it, then in my class she was at the minimum looking at the front and listening to me. Then she managed to finish two worksheets in a fashion. \n\nIf you read this and you're a SpEd teacher of any sort, then you have my total awe because this whole process was HARD. Anyone who can do this full-time is a superhero. I'm just taking the small victories here.

I\031ll try my best to explain what I\031m looking for.\nEvery 9 weeks we have to reevaluate our RTI groups, figure out which group each student goes to and when. Is there a website or program to help with making our groups so we don\031t accidentally have kids scheduled to be two places at once?\nWe have two 30 min RTI blocks (we call them RTI-A and RTI-B). We have two enrichment teachers, one tier 2 math teacher, one tier 2 reading teacher, one reading specialist, and one math specialist. \nFor example, Sally needs to see both the math and reading specialists. Somehow she ended up being put on the list for both teachers during RTI-A. Obviously she can\031t be two places at once.\nAre there any  free websites or programs that can help us?\nThanks!
How my supplies last                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           So I\031ve been doing this for 2 years now and it has worked pretty well so I thought I\031d share it with y\031all.\n\nI had my TA make general supply bins. It comes with basic class necessities like color pencils, markers, pencils, etc. for students to get one they exchange their cell phones, airpods, or backpack. There is a checklist in the bin and at the end of class (5 min before dismissal) they return it by going down the list and showing me or my TA each item. If pencils or color pencils are not sharpened or broken, or things are not accounted for they got to go find it or replace it. They can also use our pbis money thing to pay a fine but it is an exorbitant amount like in the 800-1000. Most of their friends tend not to give away their money because they\031re usually saving it up for a free mile pass or a free snack/ice cream from admin (they also charge a lot). Checking each person goes by pretty fast and I usually do 2 at a time.\n\nOnce everything is good, they place it back in a box and I hand them their phone. Magically, my supplies last 3/4 of the year with only the most common things needing to be replaced like the erasers or golf pencils.\n\nChromebook chargers are separate and require the same materials in exchange. There is a form for this and each charger is labeled. If they already handed their phone, they got to hand the backpack. If they only got a backpack, they got to ask a friend for some collateral.\n\nHope this helps someone!
Need guidance on rewards/prizes!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I teach first grade and my group needs so much positive reinforcement that I think I need to start giving out rewards/prizes daily (even every 5 minutes if that was possible lol). I am admittedly horrible with empty threats/consequences. We are PBIS and if they have 20 rewards (our school wide reward system) then they get to pick a prize on Fridays. As I stated above, my class needs more of an immediate reward. Friday is too far away/ they start to not care. Does anyone have any suggestions for my sanity? I really didn't want to do candy but it seems to be the only thing that they go crazy for. I love them but I need haaaaaalp!

I have a student who is absolutely destroying the passion I once had for teaching. I can hardly get one word out while teaching without being disrupted by him. He just yells out the most random things, sometimes they are inappropriate, sometimes they are mean comments about other students. Some of the other students think he's funny, some of them tell him to stop, and the others are just silently waiting for the lesson to start/continue. He has autism and adhd, mom will not put him back on meds because he told her that he didn't like them. He has physically grabbed his laptop from my hands, screamed at me and other students, thrown objects, cussed, constantly goes on websites he's not supposed to, leaves the classroom.\n\nWe have him on a behavior contract. I am constantly filling out behavior forms and sending them to my principal as is our behavior protocol, she never does anything in response. I call for help from the office with him all the time. I've talked to his mom almost daily. Now she is saying maybe he needs to be put in a "special class" because she doesn't know what to do. He is capable of doing grade level math and reading, but he just doesn't do anything but disrupt all day. \n\nI have been teaching for several years now. I do  positive reinforcement strategies all day long, but this kid could care less. He gets such a thrill disrupting. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. It is so disruptive and affecting my classroom to the point where I can barely talk and teach. Is there not an ed code/protocol or something about students disrupting other students learning? I feel like I'm drowning. :(
What do you want from a BCBA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Sorry if I chose the wrong flair, I'm a recent former sub and I didn't see others that fit any better. I made a brief comment with a similar question, and someone replied that it might make a good OP.\n\nHey all, I was going to go for a SPED credential and spent a few years subbing first and I realized that I actually enjoy working with students with problem behaviors, but I hate trying to manage an entire classroom while doing so. The district had me pinch hit as a behavior para after one school's quit and nobody wanted the position. I got to know the BCBA for the district, and I got to know some of the teachers with the most significant behavioral issues.\n\nI saw that the principles of ABA can conflict with both traditional common sense understandings of behavior, and also their intervention plans and data collection schemes can be wildly impractical to the point of being almost laughable for teachers in the trenches.\n\nStill, I've seen the principles and techniques of ABA work. In a controlled setting, with a properly trained behavior technician or analyst, meaningful change in behaviors and attitudes can be created and reinforced. I've used really basic informal ABA principles to help my own daughter quit throwing tantrums and learn to effectively regulate her emotions and behaviors. I've also seen ABA techniques haphazardly implemented by people who don't even buy into the idea, and I've seen absolute failure in those instances. I've seen teachers pissed at the BCBA for, with the best of intentions, making unreasonable and impossible demands.\n\nSo, my question is this. I'm going to become a BCBA, and I want to work in the schools. I think there's the potential to achieve meaningful positive outcomes for students through that work, and that's all that matters, right? So, what do you teachers want and need from me? What considerations would you wish your fucking behaviorists would make to achieve actual meaningful results? What is the batshit craziest thing the behavior team at your school has asked you to do, and how would you rather they have approached it?\n\nAt the end of the day, I don't want to wander around making unrealistic suggestions and requests of teachers and students, and just end up being disliked and useless. I hear so many teachers complain about behaviorists, but I've also seen the principles of ABA work. It's not just handing out M&amp;amp;Ms like crack rocks to bribe kids to stfu. That's not ABA even if it seems to be what a lot of SPED classrooms do, and how a lot of behavior plans end up being implemented on the ground. How do I be an agent for good in helping to bridge that gap?

Most of my teaching experience is at the elementary level but I really do want to teach at the HS level. Can you please give me insight on questions they may ask me and questions I should ask them? Thanks!
Questioning my path                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This is my second year of teaching. I teach for a charter school and switched to a different school within the network.\n\nMy first school had some issues, but it was still an enjoyable place to work &amp;amp; I met some amazing people there. Fast forward to this year and I feel so lost. \nI am growing increasingly frustrated with the amount of after school working we are expected to do, the benefits are laughable (I had better benefits at retail jobs) &amp;amp; I am having a hard time adjusting to the new environment. When I first started other teachers warned me the teacher before me left because she had no support. I didn\031t want to believe them, but now I understand why. \n\nI am the only teacher in the school with my position and it\031s exhausting. I feel there is such a lack of support from admin. I am juggling 42 students across six grade levels &amp;amp; I just found out that now I have to co-plan and co-teach classes these students are in. \nI have absolutely zero time to do all of this. \nIt sucks because I am so stretched thin and I cannot provide the quality of education that my students deserve. \n\nI know it\031s difficult for all of us right now, but I don\031t know what to do. I love teaching &amp;amp; I don\031t want to leave it, but is it going to be any better at another place? I just hate that I feel this way.

<p>Examining the post titles for the top rated posts from the last month, we can see that top posts largely appear to refer to negative topics (“I got written up”), pertain to student behaviors (“Well I Got Spit On”), and generally appear to express discontent with current services or supports in schools (” ‘PBIS distinguished’ is just a ‘don’t work here’ marker at this point.”). In contrast the bottom posts appear to be requesting specific resources (“Interview Questions”, “Need guidance on rewards/prizes!”), or expressing positive sentiments (“I got the grant!”). However, the bottom posts also seem to express negative sentiments (“Questioning my path”). Based on this qualitative review, we might expect that posts pertaining to MTSS are likely to be negatively valenced overall and likely pertain to discussing challenging behaviors with students or about systemic issues within schools.</p>
<p>In order to assess the sentiments of posts, we will need to do some additional data cleaning. First, posts are “unnested” using the <code>unnest_tokens()</code> function which takes each post and title and separates them into single words, and completes some basic data cleaning, such as stemming or removing suffixes from words, removing numbers, and removing punctuation. Next, stop words, or common words that do not communicate much information (e.g.&nbsp;I, you, he, she, they, etc.) are removed as this will help to reduce the computational demands of the analysis and increase clarity. We can then view the top most frequently occurring words. From these words, a few things can be observed. First, “support” appears to be the most frequently occurring word, which bodes well for the data collection procedure as we are interested in posts that revolve around MTSS and support structures in schools more generally. We can also see that words such as “teachers” or word fragments, such as “ve” do not communicate meaningful information. These can be removed by setting custom stop words and filtering them out of our data.</p>

<p>With our newly filtered data, we can also visualize words using a word cloud. Words such as “support”, “behavior”, and “feel” appear frequently, potentially indicating that many of our posts are likely to be about behavior and support structures in school and potentially about how teachers feel about them.</p>

<p>Now that we have completed our data cleaning, we can begin our sentiment analysis. For this the <code>vader_df</code> function is used, which takes each word and compares it against a dictionary of words that are assigned a valence rating ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive). Words that cannot be classified by VADER are assigned a score of 0 (neutral). We can summarize the data as a ratio between negative and positive posts by defining “positive” as post values that are equal to or above .05 and “negative” posts as those at or below -.05.</p>

<p>After running VADER and calculating a positive to negative ratio, we can see that there are 12, 392 positive words, 14,045 negative words and the vast majority of words are neutral (128, 526). A large proportion of neutral words is expected as many positive and negative messages are composed of mostly neutral terms. For example “I had a great day at work today” has 7 neutral words and 1 positive word (“great”), and only requires 1 word to change to become negative, “I had a terrible day at work today”. Examining the proportion of scores, we can see there are slightly more negative sentiments expressed on posts about MTSS on r/Teachers. We can check to see how well our classification algorithm did by examining the top positive and negative valenced words directly.</p>

<p>Examining the top 10 most frequently occurring positive and negative words, we can see that VADER did a decent job at classifying sentiments, with words such as “love”, “friends”, and “care”. However, other words may be more ambiguous in meaning and depend on their context. For example “support” is considered to be positive; however, a larger context for this word may indicate that teachers need more support, which would be a negative sentiment. In contrast, the negative words appear to be more accurately classified with words such as “hard”, “leave”, “stop” and “bad” being among the most frequently occurring. However, in order to gain more context on how these words are used, we need to examine what topics are being discussed on r/Teachers.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="question-2-what-topics-are-most-frequently-discussed-by-educators-on-reddit-regarding-mtss">Question 2: What topics are most frequently discussed by educators on Reddit regarding MTSS?</h2>
<p>To answer the second question, topic modeling is utilized. Topic modeling is a form of unsupervised machine learning in which latent structures are uncovered across documents. In essence, topic modeling seeks to uncover recurring themes or ideas that occur across multiple documents such as social media posts in order to uncover broader ideas or topics being discussed through text [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Churchill2022">Churchill and Singh (<a href="#ref-Churchill2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> ]. Topic modeling can be used to better understand the distribution of topics discussed across documents. While sentiment analysis can help to answer how individuals feel, topic modeling tells us about what individuals discuss. Similar to sentiment analysis, there are several approaches to topic modeling; however, one of the most common is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA treats each document, such as a Reddit post, as a mixture of multiple different topics and each topic is a mixture of different words that can be shared across topics. By allowing overlap of words between topics, LDA replicates how language is naturally used where words can have multiple meanings depending on the context [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Silge2017">Robinson and David (<a href="#ref-Silge2017" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span> ].</p>
<p>Data preparation for topic modeling is similar to what was conducted for sentiment analysis. However, instead of “unnesting” terms, we need to clean terms and remove stop words, numbers, punctuation, and suffixes while retaining each document’s original structure. Doing so will allow us to examine what topics are being discussed across posts. The following data cleaning method is adapted from <span class="citation" data-cites="schweinberger2024">Schweinberger (<a href="#ref-schweinberger2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span></p>

The goal is to have CaoJuan2010 be as close to 0 as possible and Deveaud2014 as close to 1 as possible. This process is akin to generating and examining scree plots in factor analysis.</p>

<p>Based on our graphs, it appears that the data is best represented by four topics. We can now conduct our LDA by first specifying in “k” the number of topics we want LDA to generate. Next, a seed is set in order to reproduce this result in future analyses. Finally, a LDA model is specified using the Gibbs sampling method, which is a probabilistic method for assigning words to topics and set the analysis to run 500 times to get stable topic assignments [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Lukitoj2020">Lukito (<a href="#ref-Lukitoj2020" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span> ].</p>

<p>Examining the top 5 words from each topic, we can see that Topic 1 largely pertains to student/classroom behaviors, Topic 2 appears to pertain to classroom logistics, such as the day and time, Topic 3 appears to be about administrator and teacher support, and Topic 4 appears to be about teacher well-being. Using these broad labels, we can now examine how many times each of these topics appears as the primary topic in a post. This can be accomplished by examining the proportion of posts for each of the four topics and dividing by the total number of posts.</p>

<p>Results indicate the primary topic discussed across posts regarding MTSS was about student behavior (45 posts), then classroom logistics (40), teacher well-being (38) and admin and teacher support (32). Thus, it appears that the most frequently discussed topic across posts regarding MTSS on r/Teachers is about Student Behaviors.</p>
<p>Finally, we can check our work by using our topic labels to filter data from the whole data set where words assigned to that topic represent a large proportion of overall words used in the post. Using Topic 1 “Student Behaviors” posts where 40% of more of the entire post was composed of words found in Topic 1 were selected resulting in 3 posts meeting criteria.</p>

I'm in the middle of wrapping up the preliminary planning stuff for my lesson when this special education teacher walks in to my office with the failing student and asks if I have time to talk then. I said no that I have another student to meet with and I schedule a meeting for the next day with this kid, which is all fine.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that this isn't the first time this particular special education teacher has just popped in on me during one of my prep periods. Is this expected behavior? (I'm coming from a private school background where support staff is quite limited in comparison). I think it wouldn't feel so violating if they sent an email or scheduled time or didn't just come in and assume because I had a prep I had nothing to do? I currently have around 60 essays I need to grade across classes and am only in my second year here so am still developing all my curricula. I know this teacher probably doesn't understand what the workload of an English teacher (with 3 preps) is like, but I really don't understand the mindset.\n\nSo, I'm feeling pretty frustrated and almost like I have to find a new, private place to take my preps, so I don't have any surprise interruptions."</code></pre>

<td><pre><code>"Hi All,  \n  \nI'm finishing my master's in special education. I have a presentation due Friday I'm almost done working on, but having trouble with this final part. I can't find SPECIFIC Positive Behavior Support Strategies that go along with Specific Learning Disability and Traumatic Brain Injury that are research-based. I've gone through so many databases but can't find anything.\n\nHere is the portion that I need to fulfill:\n\n||\n||\n|The presentation includes 3 research-based Positive Behavioral Strategies and interventions, in alignment with both specified classifications. This is a total of 6 strategies/interventions.|\n\nIf anyone has any website that's reputable that would be great. My goal was to find a research-article, but a well-known organization or gov't backed site will be amazing as well.\n\nThank you!"</code></pre></td>

<td><pre><code>"Hi everyone, I'm a brand new teacher and I feel there is way to much going on. I have a primary school class of 30 kids. With all the various needs, behaviors, and complete lack of support, I'm at such a loss. I have several kids with ADHD, one with severe autism, 3 at least that completely refuse work, and just one EA for 3 hours a day... \n\nMy dream was to do a great job at this and I am truly very passionate about teaching, but quite honestly, I'm concerned about my mental health. I work 12-14 hours all day, every day. I have NO time for a life outside of work, and every day fills me with absolute dread and anxiety. I spend so much time building relationships and I know my kids like me, but it's just all too much. I'm only 1 person and I feel like I'm doing 6 different jobs. Are there any suggestions you have for someone who loves education, but just can't handle this situation?\n\nThank you =-"</code></pre></td>

<td><pre><code>"I can't tell if I should feel frustrated with this.\n\nToday, during my prep period, I had a special ed teacher come find me with our student who never submitted an essay for English and so is currently failing.\n\n(Context for essay: we had 4 in-class writing days, I reached out multiple times in person and via email to try to schedule a meeting with this kid, I put some basic quotes / ideas for structure into the graphic organizer FOR them on the first writing day, and they haven't touched it or done anything since).\n\nI had already mapped out my prep period for the day: I needed to split the time between creating a lesson for the next period and meeting with a different student I'd scheduled to meet with earlier this day. I'm in the middle of wrapping up the preliminary planning stuff for my lesson when this special education teacher walks in to my office with the failing student and asks if I have time to talk then. I said no that I have another student to meet with and I schedule a meeting for the next day with this kid, which is all fine.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that this isn't the first time this particular special education teacher has just popped in on me during one of my prep periods. Is this expected behavior? (I'm coming from a private school background where support staff is quite limited in comparison). I think it wouldn't feel so violating if they sent an email or scheduled time or didn't just come in and assume because I had a prep I had nothing to do? I currently have around 60 essays I need to grade across classes and am only in my second year here so am still developing all my curricula. I know this teacher probably doesn't understand what the workload of an English teacher (with 3 preps) is like, but I really don't understand the mindset.\n\nSo, I'm feeling pretty frustrated and almost like I have to find a new, private place to take my preps, so I don't have any surprise interruptions."</code></pre></td>

<p>All three of the filtered posts appear to be about behavior in some form; however, they appear to pertain to different aspects of behavior. The first two posts discuss student behavior directly. The first post is requesting advice on evidence based behavioral interventions for students with disabilities, while the second appears to be expressing frustration over student behaviors in their classroom and is seeking advice or classroom management strategies. However, the last posts appears to be seeking advice about the behavior of another staff member. Thus, the label for Topic 1 should be broadened from “Student Behavior” to encompass “Behavior” more generally.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The present case study examined the sentiments and topics discussed by educators using their posts about MTSS on the subreddit r/Teachers. Results indicate that posts discussing MTSS displayed more negative than positive sentiments and the primary topic discussed appears to be about the behavior of students and staff at school. This is consistent with prior research examining contributors to teacher burnout, in which student behavior and disrespect are consistently found to be associated with emotional exhaustion and teacher burnout [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Aloe2014">Aloe et al. (<a href="#ref-Aloe2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> ; <span class="citation" data-cites="Kollerová2023">Kollerová et al. (<a href="#ref-Kollerová2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> ]. Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="Kollerová2023">Kollerová et al. (<a href="#ref-Kollerová2023" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> also found that victimization and work place bullying from colleagues also were associated with teacher burnout. It is unsuprising then that educators posting on r/Teachers are discussing the behaviors of others in order to seek resources (such as intervention strategies) or emotional support. Other topics discussed on r/Teachers included classroom logistics, teacher well-being, and administrator and teacher support. These findings may have implications for MTSS implementation within schools more generally. First, the presence of a greater number of negatively valenced posts may indicate that teachers feel that MTSS does not work or is not working to address their specific needs. This may point to a lack of fidelity in implementation or support for educators in implementing MTSS related protocols. <span class="citation" data-cites="Houchens2017">Houchens et al. (<a href="#ref-Houchens2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> , in related research, found that teachers who are in schools implementing PBIS with high fidelity reported less burnout, greater investment into their schools and felt more empowered and involved in decision making. Second, the large number of posts discussing behaviors point to a critical need for additional support and resources in addressing behavioral concerns at school. This might begin in an increased focus on classroom behavior management skills within teacher training programs, as teachers often leave these programs receiving only minimal if any behavioral management and intervention skills [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Freeman2014">Freeman et al. (<a href="#ref-Freeman2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> ]. Further, support staff such as behavioral specialists, counselors, and school psychologists can contribute to enhancing teacher’s skill in implementing developmentally appropriate behavioral strategies in schools through providing consultation and in-service professional development [ <span class="citation" data-cites="Fan2021">Fan et al. (<a href="#ref-Fan2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> ].</p>
<p>There are several limitations of the present case study. First, data were only gathered over the period of a month which may limit the range of topics being discussed. It may be that taking a sample from a larger time period may reveal other topics that were not captured in the present study. Given the computational demands of text mining, future research may be able to address this limitation through the use of more powerful computers or the use of simultaneous processing. In addition, this study is limited in its scope and analysis by the nature of data on r/Teachers. This subreddit does not verify that authors of posts are educators, nor does it use tags or “flairs” to identify what role educators occupy (e.g.&nbsp;first grade teacher, principal, special education teacher). While it can be assumed that the majority of authors who choose to post on r/Teachers are likely to be teachers or other educational professionals working in schools, there is no current way to verify their status given the anonymous nature of Reddit. Future research may partially overcome this limitation through the use of additional filters to identify posts where authors self-identify “I’m a third grade teacher”, or “I am a principal”. While this approach still relies on authors to self-identify, doing so would provide some additional evidence that authors are educational professionals and are not other parties who may be interested in education , such as parents. In addition, this approach may allow for additional analysis to examine how teachers across different grade-levels perceive and discuss MTSS as well as how other educational professionals perceive and discuss MTSS. Finally, the views of educators posting on r/Teachers overall, and may reflect those that are particularly struggling with MTSS implementation or who are more likely to use social media websites such as Reddit. However, r/Teachers still represents a community with over 1.2 million members. Thus, the views of these members are still likely to be impactful within schools and merits study.</p>
<p>Overall, educators on r/Teachers appear to have a negative perception of MTSS and discuss the behavior of others the most in their posts. Students across developmental periods are likely to exhibit markedly different behavioral challenges as their cognitive, motor, social, and linguistic capabilities grow. Thus, any behavioral intervention approach will need to comprehensively address and equip educators to address the varying needs of students while at the same time being respected and followed by adults on campus as well.</p>
